	"description": "You don't like cold. Staying on a cold place will start to lower your temperature. A bar of cold will start to increase. Having some cold will apply you slowness plus slightly blue skin. Reaching Max cold will increase the slowness level and blue tone, and you will start to get damage. Cold will naturally decrease after leaving the cold place."
